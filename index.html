	<h1>Hi there, I'm Christine Strange!</h1>
    <p>I <em>love</em> to code and write, so when I heard GitHub was allowing folks to create websites I had to try it out. It's easy! Even for someone who has never worked with Jekyll before. Here's more about me: <a href="/about">About Me</a></p>
	<p>Here is a link to a few articles I wrote: <a href="/blog">My Blog</a></p>
