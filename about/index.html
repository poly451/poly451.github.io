			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Who am I? I guess I'm a person who knows a little bit of this and a little bit of that. I've programmed for most of my life and, currently, Python is my favorite language. It's fun, it's easy. What's not to like?</p>
			<p>Every once in a while (read: all the time!) I have trouble figuring something out and I think--maybe!--others have had the same problem. So, hopefully, something I write will help someone else. If so--or if you'd like me to write about a particular topic--please leave a comment, contacct me on Twitter or--I know this is old school!--send me an email. :-)</p>
